** Notes and Assumptions
- A deeper dive into graphs is needed to improve visualization
- Oz lib have bugs and not 100% corresponds to Vega
- `Next week` simplified to next 7 days
- Perhaps it was worth doing it without third-party libraries
- Ready-made implementations worthy of attention - Google Calendar, Italki
