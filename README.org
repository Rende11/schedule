* User Availability Visualisation
The purpose of the App is to visualize user availability intervals - for today, tomorrow and the next 7 days. You also have an editor for manually editing records.

** Made with
- Oz
- Vega-lite

** Notes and Assumptions
- A deeper dive into graphs is needed to improve visualization
- Oz lib have bugs and not 100% corresponds to Vega
- `Next week` simplified to next 7 days
- Perhaps it was worth doing it without third-party libraries
- Ready-made implementations worthy of attention - Google Calendar, Italki
